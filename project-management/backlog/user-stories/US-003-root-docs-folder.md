## Description

Create a `docs/` folder at the project root (outside of `project-management/`) to hold project-level documentation such as architecture overviews, API documentation, or user guides that are distinct from the project-management workflow.

## User Story

As a developer or stakeholder, I want a root-level `docs/` folder for project documentation, so that I can separate general project docs from the project-management structure and keep the repository organized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/` folder created at project root (sibling to `project-management/`)
- [x] README.md or placeholder added to document the folder's purpose
- [x] Structure documented in project README or relevant process docs

## Business Value

Improves repository organization by providing a clear location for project-level documentation that does not belong in the project-management workflow (processes, templates, backlog).

## Technical Requirements

- Create `docs/` at repository root
- Add a README.md explaining the folder's purpose and what belongs there

## Dependencies

- None

## Clarifying Questions

*AI: Before starting implementation, ask the user clarifying questions. Document questions and answers here after the user responds.*

## History

- 2026-03-06 - Created
- 2026-03-21 - Added `docs/README.md` and root `README.md` layout; status ✅ Done
