# Project Management Index

**AI: Start here.** This file is the single entry point for AI-assisted project management. Use it to find the right process and context for each task.

## Processes and When to Run

| Task | Process File | When to Run |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Sprint planning | [sprint-planning-process.md](processes/sprint-planning-process.md) | Start of sprint, after retrospective |
| Sprint review | [sprint-review-process.md](processes/sprint-review-process.md) | End of sprint, before retrospective |
| Sprint retrospective | [sprint-retrospective-process.md](processes/sprint-retrospective-process.md) | End of sprint, after sprint review |
| Backlog refinement | [backlog-management-process.md](processes/backlog-management-process.md) | Weekly or bi-weekly |
| Documentation-Code Consistency + Technical Debt Identification Scan | [doc-code-consistency-process.md](processes/doc-code-consistency-process.md), [technical-debt-identification-process.md](processes/technical-debt-identification-process.md) | Before commit (AI-assisted work) |
| Release notes | [release-notes-process.md](processes/release-notes-process.md) | Each push/merge to main, end of sprint |
| Escalation | [escalation-process.md](processes/escalation-process.md) | When blockers or risks require escalation |

## Paths and Naming

| Type | ID Format | Path |
|------|-----------|------|
| User stories | US-XXX | `backlog/user-stories/US-XXX-*.md` |
| Defects | DEF-XXX | `backlog/defects/DEF-XXX-*.md` |

| Retrospective Improvements (from retrospectives) | RI-XXX | `backlog/retrospective-improvements/RI-XXX-*.md` |
| Architecture Decision Records | ADR-XXX | `architecture-decision-records/ADR-XXX-*.md` |
| Sprints | sprint-XX | `sprints/sprint-XX-*.md` |

## Pre-Commit Flow

For AI-assisted work, the flow before commit is:

1. **Documentation-Code Consistency Check** — AI compares code with documentation; generates gap report
2. **Technical Debt Scan** — AI identifies new technical debt from changes
3. **Human approval** — Human reviews report and decides what to update
4. **Definition of Done** — Verify all acceptance criteria met
5. **Commit** — Proceed only after human approval

See [doc-code-consistency-process.md](processes/doc-code-consistency-process.md) for details.

## AI Workflow Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Task Start] --> Clarify[Clarifying Questions]
    Clarify --> Implement[Implementation]
    Implement --> Gap[Documentation-Code Consistency Check]
    Implement --> TD[Technical Debt Scan]
    Gap --> Human[Human Approval]
    TD --> Human
    Human --> DoD[Definition of Done]
    DoD --> Commit[Commit]
```

**Key steps**: Task start → clarifying questions → implementation → Documentation-Code Consistency + Technical Debt Identification Scan → human approval → Definition of Done → commit.
